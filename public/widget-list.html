        <p>
            Two months after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro visited his counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara,
            a mysterious company called Sardes sprang into existence. The firm started business with a bang in January of
            2018, when it imported about $41 million worth of gold from Venezuela, the first such transaction between the
            two countries in records that go back 50 years. The next month its volume more than doubled, with Sardes
            transporting almost $100 million worth to Turkey.

            By November, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order authorizing sanctions on Venezuelan gold
            -- after sending an envoy to warn Turkey off the trade, Sardes had shuttled $900 million of the precious metal
            out of the country. Not bad for a company with just $1 million in capital, according to regulatory filings in
            Istanbul.

            Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com Inc., accused National Enquirer’s publisher of trying to blackmail him by
            threatening to release embarrassing photos, escalating a fight that began with the tabloid’s revelations of his
            alleged extramarital affair.

            In a lengthy post on the web platform Medium, Mr. Bezos alleges that American Media Inc. demanded that he call
            off investigators he brought in to determine how the Enquirer obtained his personal text messages for the
            initial article it published and whether it had untoward motives...
